# TABL
Tool-Assisted Backing Loop

A simple music tool that generates chords progression based on a tonic key and a scale (that both may be either chosen or picked randomly).

This works with `Tkinter` for the GUI, and `fluidsynth` for the sound. You may need to change the audio driver for your operating system. `PulseAudio` should work on modern Linux distributions. 

You can change the soundfont to another (by default, this program uses `TimGM6mb.sf2` which is light enough to be provided within a github repository).

## TO DO

* Features:
    * Make a loop on selected chord progression
    * Let the user choose the time step
    * Add a button to see all triads
    * Add a button to see all sevenths
    * Let the user design its own scale
    * Include circle of fifths and other graphical / pedagogical tools
    
* GUI:
    * Improve scale display by putting a tabulation for each semitone not valid in a scale
    * When playing a chords, change color of played notes in the scale label
    * Gridify the layout of widget
    * Design a background (like VST ones ?)
    * Disable loop button when playing something else
    
* Music engine:
    * Build a transcoder from binary representation of tones into actual scale (i.e. 101011010101 = Major)
    * Fix octave drift when playing triads
    * Save instrument in `last_prog` variable
    * Fix sound delay after ending loop (it doesn't last as long as others)
    * Include other scales
    * Include other chords ( 7, dim, aug, Ø, Δ, 6 etc.. )
    * Fix the time synchronization when `time_step` is changed while playing

## Done

* Features:
    * Randomly generate a tonic and a scale
    * Play the scale and print the valid notes
    * Add a button to randomize again
    * Add a replay button
    * Let the user choose a tonic note
    * Add a button to listen all triads of the current scale and last selected tonic
    * Let the user choose a scale
    * Add a button to listen all sevenths
    * Generate a random chord progression
    * Let the user choose instrument with a slider
    * Make the replay button replay the last thing played (note only the current scale, but also last chord progression)
    * Make a loop on last chord progression

* GUI:
    * Make the tonic change the color (e.g. A = 440 Hz, add 0x440 to the hexacode of a scale)
    * Print the current note being played
    * Print the current chord being played
    * Fix screen synchronization with event
    * Block all buttons when music play
    * Indicate which tonic and scale are currently selected
    * When changing scale, automatically print the new valid notes
    * Fix the state delay after stopping a loop
    * Centralize widget handling in `update_gui()`
    * Auto-reconfigure the layout to correspond to what is played when pressing replay or loop button (determine scale and tonic to refresh layout)
    * Make fontground color reverse to background color
    * Make sliders begin to default value
    
* Music engine:
    * Build a function that play notes
    * Build a function that play chords
    * Build a function that play scale
    * Build a function that play all triads within a given scale
    * Make all times affected by `time_step` variable and stop notes after a while (useful for some instruments with high sustain)

# TABL
Tool-Assisted Backing Loop

A simple music tool that generates chords progression based on a tonic key and a scale (that both may be either chosen or picked randomly).

This works with `Tkinter` for the GUI, and `fluidsynth` for the sound. You may need to change the audio driver for your operating system. `PulseAudio` should work on modern Linux distributions. 

You can change the soundfont to another (by default, this program uses `TimGM6mb.sf2` which is light enough to be provided within a github repository).
